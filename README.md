Front-End Web Development Nano-Degree - Resume Project
=====================================================

What Is It?
------------------------------------

A simple online resume highlighting various web-related projects as well as my bio, skills, and work experience.


What Did I Learn?
------------------------------------

In this project I built an online resume summarizing and providing links to previous projects. I added resume information to various JavaScript objects according to a specific schema, wrote a display function encapsulated in each object, and utilized the Google Maps API to include an interactive map to display information based on data in the resume objects.
