Front-End Web Development Nano-Degree - Resume Project
=====================================================
What did I learn in this project?
------------------------------------

In this project I was asked to store resume data in JavaScript objects according to a specific schema, write a display function encapsulated in each object, and utilize the Google Maps API to include an interactive map to display information based on data in the resume objects.
